It presents your self-ratings against the Management and<br>Leadership Framework competencies.</p><hr><h2>Reminder of the rating scale</h2><p>You were asked to consider the extent to which you demonstrate each competence in your<br>work, using the following capability scale:</p><p>1. <strong>Insufficient</strong> – I can’t do this without help.</p><p>This means you do not yet meet the required standard</p><ul><li><p>Limited or minimal evidence of the competence in day-to-day work.</p></li><li><p>May indicate a lack of familiarity, confidence, understanding or opportunity to apply<br>the competence.</p></li></ul><p>2. <strong>Essential</strong> – I can do parts of this but need guidance.</p><p>This means you meet the minimum acceptable standard in routine and predictable situations</p><ul><li><p>Demonstrated reliably in routine situations.</p></li><li><p>Shows an understanding of the core competence but may still require support or<br>development to apply it consistently in more complex scenarios.</p></li></ul><p>3. <strong>Proficient</strong> – I can do most of this with occasional help.</p><p>This means you perform adequately and consistently across a range of situations</p><ul><li><p>Shows confidence and autonomy in most situations.</p></li><li><p>Represents solid, competent practice for much of your role.</p></li></ul><p>4. <strong>Strong</strong> – I can do all of this independently.</p><p>This means you consistently perform above the expected standard</p><ul><li><p>Demonstrated across more complex, challenging or unpredictable situations.</p></li><li><p>Others are likely to benefit from or recognise your strength in this area.</p></li></ul><p>5. <strong>Exemplary</strong> – I always do this well and support others to do this.</p><p>This means you always excel and set the benchmark for performance, role modelling beyond<br>your own remit and developing others</p><ul><li><p>Demonstrated consistently and with significant positive influence on people, teams, or<br>systems.</p></li><li><p>Represents practice and skills that others may learn from or adopt.</p></li></ul><hr><h2>How to use this report</h2><p><br>This report is a developmental tool designed to support reflection, insight, and focussed<br>management and leadership growth. It should be used as part of your appraisal and<br>developmental conversations with your line manager, noting the following considerations:</p><ul><li><p>Review with reflective curiosity</p><ul><li><p>Approach your results openly. The aim is to understand how you perceive<br>your current strengths and development needs, not to form a judgement about<br>performance.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Recognise your strengths</p><ul><li><p>Identify where you have rated yourself most confidently. These areas form an<br>important foundation for your leadership practice and can be built upon to<br>enhance your impact.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Identify priority development areas</p><ul><li><p>Focus on the competencies that will make the greatest difference to your<br>effectiveness and future progression. Not every lower rating requires action—<br>prioritisation is key.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Shape a focused development plan</p><ul><li><p>Use the insights to select one to three meaningful development priorities.<br>Consider what good practice looks like, the support you may need, and how<br>you will monitor progress.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Use your report in appraisals and development conversations</p><ul><li><p>Bring your reflections into discussions with your manager or coach. These<br>conversations can help refine priorities, identify opportunities, and clarify next<br>steps.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Revisit the report periodically</p><ul><li><p>Treat the report as a living reference point. Return to it as your role evolves or<br>after completing development activity to track progress and identify emerging<br>strengths.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Management and leadership framework structure: domains, standards and competencies</h2><p><img src="http://assess.test/storage/media/DO6CW39pOo9Jp5MEN0BVCqzDJQRhI3CdAUAdNZfh.png" alt="Framework wheel diagram" data-id="media/DO6CW39pOo9Jp5MEN0BVCqzDJQRhI3CdAUAdNZfh.png"></p><div class="grid-layout" data-cols="3" style="--cols: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr));" data-from-breakpoint="lg"><div class="grid-layout-col" data-col-span="1" style="--col-span: span 1 / span 1;"><h3>Personal Impact</h3><p><strong>Personal productivity and wellbeing</strong></p><ul><li><p>Prioritise for personal productivity</p></li><li><p>Develop personal health and wellbeing strategies</p></li><li><p>Commit to continuing professional development</p></li></ul><p><strong>Communicating well</strong></p><ul><li><p>Communicate with clarity and purpose</p></li><li><p>Encourage open dialog and feedback</p></li><li><p>Influence, negotiate and manage upwards</p></li></ul><p><strong>Responsibility and integrity</strong></p><ul><li><p>Take accountability for my actions</p></li><li><p>Be visible, transparent and present</p></li><li><p>Manage with civility and compassion</p></li></ul></div><div class="grid-layout-col" data-col-span="1" style="--col-span: span 1 / span 1;"><h3>Managing People and Resources</h3><p><strong>Personal productivity and wellbeing</strong></p><ul><li><p>Prioritise for personal productivity</p></li><li><p>Develop personal health and wellbeing strategies</p></li><li><p>Commit to continuing professional development</p></li></ul><p><strong>Communicating well</strong></p><ul><li><p>Communicate with clarity and purpose</p></li><li><p>Encourage open dialog and feedback</p></li><li><p>Influence, negotiate and manage upwards</p></li></ul><p><strong>Responsibility and integrity</strong></p><ul><li><p>Take accountability for my actions</p></li><li><p>Be visible, transparent and present</p></li><li><p>Manage with civility and compassion</p></li></ul></div><div class="grid-layout-col" data-col-span="1" style="--col-span: span 1 / span 1;"><h3>Delivering Across Health and care</h3><p><strong>Personal productivity and wellbeing</strong></p><ul><li><p>Prioritise for personal productivity</p></li><li><p>Develop personal health and wellbeing strategies</p></li><li><p>Commit to continuing professional development</p></li></ul><p><strong>Communicating well</strong></p><ul><li><p>Communicate with clarity and purpose</p></li><li><p>Encourage open dialog and feedback</p></li><li><p>Influence, negotiate and manage upwards</p></li></ul><p><strong>Responsibility and integrity</strong></p><ul><li><p>Take accountability for my actions</p></li><li><p>Be visible, transparent and present</p></li><li><p>Manage with civility and compassion</p></li></ul></div></div>';
